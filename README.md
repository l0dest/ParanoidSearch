## Downloading and Executing
In the folder downloads you'll find zip files for **Windows** and **Linux**, once you download one, unzipping them gives you two more folders, one for the **ENGLISH** version of the game and other for the **SPANISH**.

Once you are in the desired folder you can either execute the executable or get access to the code if you want to compile it yourself. The code is free to see and download for everyone who want it. This game is mainly a test for me.
