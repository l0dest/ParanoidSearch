# Paranoid Search - C Console Game

 You're playing as a **Spy** who infiltrates an enemy base and needs to *steal* objects from it. You should take care because you have other 9 people arround you who can catch you if you don't play wisely.

All input an output information are given in the command line and you'll use certains commands to interact with you environment.

## Downloading and Executing
In the folder downloads you'll find folders for **Windows** and **Linux**, inside of them are two zip files, one for the **ENGLISH** version of the game and other for the **SPANISH**. Unzipping them gives you the codes, a makefile, a csv file used for the different names and a executable file.

Once you are in the desired folder you can either run the executable or get access to the code if you want to compile it yourself. The code is free to see and download for everyone who want it. This game is mainly a test for me.

## Game Mechanics
Your mission is to steal 30 objects from the base, you have a deadline of 7 days and you'll spend these in a base with 12 rooms, around 9 people. Each day objects can appear in all rooms and these 9 people go to random rooms.

***Each day you are granted with 8 moves, spending all of them means the end of a day***.

You can move do things interacting with a command_line-like system made in the game
